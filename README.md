# Serial Reader

Simple GUI, created with pyqt5, to read data from a serial port.

We basically use it to read data from Arduino

Work in progress... Feel free to use it if useful

## Quick Start

### Create a virtual environment

For Linux:

```
python3 -m venv env
```

For Windows:

```
py -m venv env
```

### Activate the virtual environment

For Linux:

```
source env/bin/activate
```

For Windows:

```
.\env\Scripts\activate
```

### Install packages using the provided requirements.txt file

For Linux:

```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For Windows:

```
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the GUI

From the main folder and within the virtual environment:

```
python3 -m serialReader
```
